Introduction:
  This project is to write a Lisp program to find a sequence of moves for a chess giraffe that “covers” (visits all the squares) minimally on a 7x7 chess board. 
  A square can be visited only once in a minimal “cover”.

  A "giraffe" is a special chess piece which can:
    - Move like a knight
    - Move like a rook (with the limitation that 'rook' style moves are 1 space at a time max).
  
  The goal is to print out a sequence of coordinates (as a list) which the giraffe could use to perform the minimal cover.
